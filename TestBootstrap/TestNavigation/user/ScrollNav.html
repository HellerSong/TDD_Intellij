        <p>PHP, an acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language.
            It is an HTML embedded scripting language and is especially suited for web development. The basic syntax of
            PHP
            is similar to C, Java, and Perl, and is easy to learn. PHP is used for creating interactive and dynamic web

            In 1986 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Army Research Office (ARO), the National

            Science Foundation (NSF), and ESL, Inc sponsored Berkeley POSTGRES Project which was led by Michael
            Stonebrakessr. In 1987

            the first demo version of the project is released. In June 1989, Version 1 was released to some external
            users.
            Version 2 and

            3 were released in 1990 and 1991. Version 3 had support for multiple storage managers, an query executor was
            improved, rule

            system was rewritten. After that, POSTGRES has been started to be implemented in various research and
            development projects.

            For example, in late 1992, POSTGRES became the primary data manager for the Sequoia 2000 scientific
